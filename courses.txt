Synopsis

Data Visualization is concerned with the automatic or semi-automatic generation of digital images that depict data in a meaningful way(s). It is a relatively new field of computer science that is rapidly evolving and expanding. It is also very application oriented, i.e., real tools are built in order to help scientists from other disciplines.

Syllabus

We will start off by introducing the fundamentals of visualization. Introductory topics include purposesand goals of visualization, applications, challenges, the visualization pipeline, sources of data, datadimensionality, data types, and grid types. The next sub-topic examines information visualization, thatis, visual representations of abstract data. Information visualization topics include hierarchical data,tree maps, cone trees, focus and context techniques, graphs and graph layouts, multi-dimensionaldata, scatter plots, scatter plot matrices, icons, parallel coordinates, interaction techniques, linkingand brushing. The second major sub-topic is the study of volumetric data. Volume visualization topicsinclude slicing, surface vs. volume rendering, transfer functions, interpolation schemes, direct volumevisualization, ray casting, image order vs. object order algorithms, gradients filtering, interpolation, andisosurfacing. The third major sub-topic is vector field visualization. Topics include simulation, measured,and analytical data, steady and time-dependent (unsteady) flow, direct and indirect flow visualization,applications, hedge hog plots, vector glyphs, numerical integration schemes, streamlines, streamlineplacement, geometric flow visualization techniques, texture-based techniques, and feature-based flowvisualization.

== Description ==

Overview

Computer-supported data visualization (commonly referred to as Visualization for short) is a study of transformation from data to visual representations in order to facilitate effective and efficient cognitive processes in performing tasks involving data. Visual analytics is an advanced form of visualization, in which a visualization process features a significant amount of computational analysis and human-computer interaction. Since the term was coined in 2004, visual analytics has become a de facto standard approach to the development of a practical computer-support system for understanding complex and large scale data.

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of visualization as a scholarly subject. It presents major concepts in visualization design and methods for algorithmic development, in conjunction with a close examination of several important data analysis and visualization techniques. It provides students with opportunities to explore the latest research topics in visual analytics.

Synopsis

This course covers a broad range of topics in visualization (at different levels of detail). Students will be exposed to a variety of visual representations, including basic statistical graphics; popular representations such as tag clouds, treemaps and parallel coordinates; pixel-, glyph-, graph- and map-based representations; visual representations of scalar, vector and tensor fields; and visual representations of temporal or spatiotemporal data.

In particular, students will study the methodology of formulating a visual analytics pipeline by combining interactive visualization with analytical techniques (e.g., filtering, clustering, and  dimensionality reduction), and will gain an understanding of the fundamental concept that interactive visualization helps break the conditions of data processing inequality, which is a constraint typically imposed on most automated analytical processes.

The course will help students to answer questions such as:

* What is visualization really for?
* What are the relative merits and limitations of some important techniques in visual analytics?
* What are the theoretical and technical challenges to be addressed?

== Objectives ==

== Audience/Pre-requisites ==
The prerequisites for this class are some linear algebra and calculus, as well as some programming experience. If you are unsure please come talk with me. Having taken CS-5610: Computer Graphics, or its equivalent at another university, is very helpful but not required. Grad students from other departments with the appropriate background are welcome!
== Description ==

== Objectives ==
The goal of this course is to develop a broad understanding of the principles, methods, and techniques for designing effective visualizations of data. The course will span a wide range of topics, encompassing foundations for both spatial (eg. gridded data from simulations and measurement devices) and nonspatial data (eg. graphs, text, high-dimensional tabular data), as well as the theory behind vision, color, and visualization design. You will gain experience in using cutting-edge data analysis systems, as well as in developing your own interactive visualization tools.

== Topics ==

* Design principles
* Design critiques
* Data types
* Intro to Tableau
* Visual encodings
* Data exploration
* Perception
* Color
* Intro to Processing
* Time series
* Views
* Interaction
* Tabular dat
* Filtering & aggregation
* Parallel coordinates
* Trees and graphs
* Maps
* Scalar fields
* Isosurfaces
* Scalar data
* 3d graphics
* Volume rendering
* Transfer function design
* Vector fields
* Transfer functions
* Vector fields
* Tensor fields
* Visualization models
* Design studies
* Molecular animation
