Need to make grading easier.

Start project earier as in CDS 302.

Discuss late HW alternatives (esp. after solutions have been posted).

Student's must send instructor email when ec problem has been graded.  Absolute deadline for ec problems is day before final exams start (so I have time to grade and students can revise)
